used classification algorithms in this project :

k-nearest neighbors , decision tree , logistic regression and also calculateDigitsAccuracy and calculateLettersAccuracy functions which are used to show percentage of correct recognitions . showImage and showPlot functions are used to demonstrate the pixels which are visualizing the digit and also to demonstrate the intended picture and to draw charts.

compareScores function to draw two charts in one coordinate plane in order to compare different algorhtihms.

neural network algorithms which are used in this project are :

MLP(multi layer perseptron) for learning in a neural network and MLPclassifier class that runs a MLP algorithm which trains by using back propagation.
